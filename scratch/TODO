BUGS
* You should only be able to compare 2 revisions at once.  All revisions
  between them should be highlighted though.  See http://img.skitch.com/20101109-jqaeqd4gef83cq2sbeseexhaa2.png

HIERARCHY
  _Footer.md
  _Sidebar.md
  Page1.md
  projects/
    Page2.md (uses root sidebar)
    _Footer.md
  experiments/
    _Sidebar.md
    Page3.md (uses footer.md)

Images work the same way.  You can keep similar pages in a directory with their own images.

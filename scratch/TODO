* Editor
  * Get MathJax running
* IE7 Styles
* Fix how text selections occur in IE7/8 so we actually get the right text
* Figure out why Dialogs won't fire in IE7 (likely a css issue)
* Hide help if the new JS file doesn't have working help.
* Hide function bar if language definition is malformed (non-404 results)
  
* Write Editor/Sidebar implementation notes for Rick
* Find some clever way to represent page hierarchy.

HIERARCHY
  _Footer.md
  _Sidebar.md
  Page1.md
  projects/
    Page2.md (uses root sidebar)
    _Footer.md
  experiments/
    _Sidebar.md
    Page3.md (uses footer.md)

Images work the same way.  You can keep similar pages in a directory with their own images.
